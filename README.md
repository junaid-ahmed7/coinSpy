# CoinSpy

## Introduction

Welcome to CoinSpy, a platform designed to track "sharks" on the Ethereum blockchain. By analyzing Ethereum transaction data, CoinSpy can identify high-value traders who purchased before a specified catalyst time and sold after the catalyst time.

## Features

1. **Transaction Data Input**: CoinSpy can intake a set amount of Ethereum transaction data for analysis. This is where the hunt for the sharks starts.
2. **Catalyst Time Setting**: Users can input a specific catalyst time, a crucial point in time before which the purchase is supposed to have happened and after which the sale is expected to take place.
3. **Minimum Value Setting**: Users can set a minimum value threshold for transactions. CoinSpy will only consider traders who purchased an amount above this set threshold.
4. **Shark Identification**: Based on the user input, CoinSpy identifies the "sharks" – traders who purchased above the minimum value before the catalyst time and sold after the catalyst time.

## Getting Started

### Installation

CoinSpy is a web-based application, so there's no need for a physical installation. Simply clone the repo and launch to start using CoinSpy.

## Usage

1. **Data Input**: Upload or paste your Ethereum transaction data into the designated area on your dashboard.
2. **Set Catalyst Time**: Input the specific catalyst time in the provided field. This time serves as the cutoff for determining when sharks have made their purchases and sales.
3. **Set Minimum Value**: Define the minimum value for transactions. Any transaction below this value will not be considered in the analysis.
4. **Shark Identification**: After inputting your data and settings, CoinSpy will analyze the data and provide a list of potential sharks who made transactions meeting your criteria.
